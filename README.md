# What is Shiny Sporks doing ?

This extension intends to enhance the Github pull requests' page, by :
- adding colors to the draft, requesting changes and approved pull requests (some may be added in the future, such as review required)
- adding colors to the obsolete pull requests (default is 15 days old)

It has a settings page which allows to customize the default colors

# What will Shiny Sporks do in the future ?

Better support for Firefox (storage features may have introduced bugs)

Still working on :
- custom colors by pull request names (RELEASE, BUGFIX etc.)
- allowing custom selectors (probably mostly in pull requests' name)
